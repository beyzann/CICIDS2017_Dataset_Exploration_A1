# CICIDS2017_Dataset_Exploration_A1

 The CICIDS2017 dataset is a valuable resource for those working in the field of cybersecurity. Its source, purpose, and relevance in testing and developing intrusion detection systems make it an important tool for research and education in the domain of network security.

 Contents
1. Data Preprocessing: Required for data exploration, Loading and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, performing feature selection, and applying data transformations as needed.

- Handling missing values.
- Feature selection.
- Data transformations (e.g., standardization, one-hot encoding).
- Train-test split.

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting an exploratory data analysis to gain insights into data distribution, detect patterns, and understand feature characteristics.

- Calculate summary statistics for numeric features.
- Visualize the distribution of selected numeric features.
- Visualize the class distribution.
- Analyze feature correlations.
- Create box plots to compare feature distributions among classes.
  
3. Illustrate Findings: Creating visualizations and summary statistics for illustrating findings in the CICIDS2017 dataset.   

- Class Distribution to understand the balance between the classes.
- Summary Statistics to get a sense of the numeric features in the dataset.
- Feature Distributions to visualize the distribution of specific numeric features using   histograms.
- Correlation Heatmap to explore correlations between numeric features.
- Feature Value Counts for categorical features and displayed value counts to understand   the distribution of categories.
