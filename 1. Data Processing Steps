# To be able to perform data preprocessing,
# firstly, we have to download the CICIDS2017 dataset from a trusted source,
# such as the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity website.
# Once we have the dataset files, we can load them into our preferred data analysis environment.

import pandas as pd

# For loading the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('CICIDS2017.csv')

# We need to check the dataset for missing values and decide how to handle them.
# Common strategies include removing rows with missing values or imputing missing values.

# Remove rows with missing values
dataset = dataset.dropna()

# Depending on the research or analysis we're conducting, we may want to perform feature selection to reduce dimensionality
# and improve the efficiency of our models.
